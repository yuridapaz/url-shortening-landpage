# URL shortening API landing page 

Your challenge is to integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/) to create shortened URLs and display them like in the designs.

Your users should be able to:
-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   Shorten any valid URL
-   See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
-   Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
-   Receive an error message when the  `form`  is submitted if:
-   The  `input`  field is empty
